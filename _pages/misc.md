*  My Chinese name is 李天一 (Li Tianyi). Due to the historical coincidences of the Cultural Revolution in modern Chinese history, I was born in a [Tibetan autonomous city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezuo) in China, where I spent my wonderful and unforgettable childhood. Many of my ancestors were teachers and professors in schools. 
*  During my undergraduate years, I immersed myself in literature, history, culture, and sociology by reading hundreds of books and watching over 1000 movies. I'm also a big fan of science fiction and enjoy reading works by authors such as Isaac Asimov, Cixin Liu, and Arthur Clarke. Someday, I hope to write my own science fiction novel. 
*  In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, working out, running, hiking, visiting museums, and playing tennis. I'm also a foodie and love exploring new cuisines and restaurants.

*  My Chinese name is 李天一. Due to some of the historical coincidences in modern Chinese history (Culture Revolution),  I was born in a Tibetan autonomous city in China, where I spent my wonderful and unforgettable childhood time. Most of my ancestors worked as teachers and professors in schools. 
*  When I was an undergrad student, I read hundreds of books and watched over 1000 movies related to literature, history,  culture, and sociology. I am currently a big fan of sci-fiction. 
*  I like playing basketball, working out, and recently starting to run (due to injury from basketball).

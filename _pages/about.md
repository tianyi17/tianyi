Hi! I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Intelligent Transportation Systems under the supervision of Professor [Raphael Stern](https://cse.umn.edu/cege/faculty/raphael-stern) at the University of Minnesota (UMN). You can reach me through my email address li001915 at umn dot edu. Specifically, I am working on topics that include machine learning in transportation, Transportation-Cyber-Physical systems (T-CPS),  sustainable urban mobility, and transportation-related safety. My research leverages data and computation (particularly deep learning) to apply them to traditional transportation engineering challenges and to understand and design future cities. Feel free to shoot me an email if you have ideas to discuss or projects to collaborate on.



Before attending UMN, I received my bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Iowa State University (ISU), where I was advised by Professor [Sri Sritharan](https://www.engineering.iastate.edu/people/profile/sri/) and Professor [Kejin Wang](https://www.engineering.iastate.edu/people/profile/kejinw/) for my undergraduate theses. I also hold one master's degree from the University of Washington (UW), advised by Professor [Yinhai Wang](https://www.ce.washington.edu/facultyfinder/yinhai-wang). 


I have worked as an intern/researcher for the following companies/agencies: Futurewei Technologies Research Lab (Seattle), Washington State Department of Transportation, and China Railway First Group.
